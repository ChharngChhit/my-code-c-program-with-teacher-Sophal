TODAY I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING ANYTHING
I JUST WANNA LAY IN MY BED
DON'T FEEL LIKE PICKING UP MY PHONE, SO LEAVE A MESSAGE AT THE TONE
'CAUSE TODAY I SWEAR I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING
I'M GONNA KICK MY FEET UP, THEN STARE AT THE FAN
TURN THE TV ON, THROW MY HAND IN MY PANTS
NOBODY'S GON' TELL ME I CAN'T, NO!
